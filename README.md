Creation of a search engine, using Semantic Web technologies, which searches for articles in a database via SPARQL queries using synonyms, hypernyms or hyponyms of keywords introduced by the user. For the articles database, the Protégé program was used, creating an RDF ontology file, which was then loaded into Virtuoso. The engine code was written in PHP, while HTML and CSS were used. The purpose of the engine is to search for articles with relevant semantic content of the keywords and to interact with the user, enabling him to generalize or specialize the search.
